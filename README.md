make sure you have node and mocha installed

if you have windows, [install git for windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)

if you don't have node use [nvm to install the latest stable version of node](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), then install mocha globally using the following command.

``` npm i -g mocha ```

then just run the command `mocha` in the same directory as the test.js file to see if you have properly coded the challenges or not;
